# Tetravex solver with Simulated Annealing

This a Tetravex solver but uses the heuristic Simulated Annealing technique to tackle larger problems. A statistics file is created that monitors the progress of the cost against the temperature, you can use `plot.sh` script to visualize it while any preexisting graphs are stored in `/graph` folder (in eps format).

# Notes

Please note that this script requires `Python 2.7` to be executed.
